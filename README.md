# CS-370-Pirate-Intelligent-Agent-Project
For this project, I worked on building a pirate-themed intelligent agent using reinforcement learning. We were given starter code that included the game environment setup and basic agent structure. From there, I implemented my own deep Q-learning algorithm to teach the pirate how to find treasure efficiently while avoiding traps. I adjusted hyperparameters, built out the reward logic, and handled exploration vs. exploitation strategies to improve performance over time.

Throughout the course, I learned how reinforcement learning and neural networks can be used to solve complex, real-world problems where clear rules or outcomes aren’t always obvious. This project especially helped me understand how agents learn from trial and error, and how important things like reward shaping and state/action tracking are to performance.

More broadly, this course tied into the bigger picture of computer science. Computer scientists solve problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces, designing logical systems to approach them, and using data to improve those systems over time. Whether it’s in AI or software development, that problem-solving mindset is at the core of everything we do.

I’ve also come to understand that as a developer, I have an ethical responsibility to think about how the tools I build affect people—whether that’s in how data is collected, how users interact with a system, or how fair or safe an AI model is. It’s not just about making something that works—it’s about making something that works responsibly.
